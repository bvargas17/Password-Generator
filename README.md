## Contribution
- - - - 
Created an application for employees so that they can generate randomized passwords that meet certain criteria to create strong passwords for better security. The application when clicked on the “generate password” button walks the user through a few questions so the user can choose his criteria for his password.  The password has a minimum length of 8 characters and a maximum length of 128, other than that the user can choose between lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and special characters. The password will contain at least one character of each criteria picked.
